# CPP09
42 Milestone 5

This module doesn't have an specific theme, they are more complex exercises that use everything taught from cpp05 to cpp08. A different STL container is required for every exercise.

---
- ex 00: Easy find
```
	Use algorithms to create a function that finds an element within a container.
```
- ex 01: Span
```
	Recreate the container span (unavailable in c++98) as a simple class.
```
- ex 02: Mutated abomination
```
	Create a MutantStack class that is just a stack with iterators.
```
